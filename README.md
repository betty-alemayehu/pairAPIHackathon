# Pair-Programming API Hackathon

## ðŸŽ¯ The Challenge

To create an interactive, customizable React app that provides comprehensive yoga pose information via API.

---

### **Mission**

Our team is focused on building an interactive platform for exploring, tracking, and sharing yoga poses, enabling users to personalize their yoga journey and collaborate on pose alignment, technique, and inspiration.

---

## **Features**

Practice is a web-based yoga app where users can:

- **Explore Poses**: Browse through a catalog of yoga poses with descriptions and images.
- **Track Progress**: Mark poses as "completed" and save personalized images for each pose.

**Example**: A user marks the "Tree Pose" as completed, uploads a custom alignment photo, and shares it with friends for feedback.

---

## **Hackathon Flow**

1. **Planning**: Setting goals, defining roles, and onboarding everyone to the tools.
2. **Idea Selection**: Structured, collaborative ideation and prioritization process.
3. **Prototyping**: Building a functional MVP using a mix of research, design, and code.
4. **Presentation**: Sharing the final product and insights learned during the hackathon.
